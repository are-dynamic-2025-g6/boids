Overview:
The boids algorithm works and is able to simulate the flocking behavior of birds (as well as display other flocking behaviors like fish etc...) by making use of a simple set of three rules and varying factors:

Separation is the first rule the boids algorithm makes use of, it specifies and makes the "birds" stray away from each other, so as to not bump / overlapp over one another.

Cohesion:

Alignement:
